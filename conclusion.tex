In this work, we explore the impact of workload uncertainty on the performance
    of LSM tree-based databases, and introduce {\Endure}, a robust tuning
    paradigm that recommends optimal designs to mitigate any performance
    degradation in the presence of workload uncertainty.
We show that in the presence of uncertainty, robust tunings increase database
    throughput compared to standard tunings by up to $5 \times$.
Additionally, we provide evidence that our analytical model closely matches the
    behavior measured on a database system.
{\Endure} can be used as an indispensable tool for database administrators
    to both evaluate the performance of tunings, and recommend optimal tunings
    in a few seconds without resorting to expensive database experiments.
