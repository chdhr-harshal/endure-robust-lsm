  abstract  = "In this paper we focus on robust linear optimization problems
               with uncertainty regions defined by ?-divergences (for example,
               chi-squared, Hellinger, Kullback?Leibler). We show how
               uncertainty regions based on ?-divergences arise in a natural
               way as confidence sets if the uncertain parameters contain
               elements of a probability vector. Such problems frequently occur
               in, for example, optimization problems in inventory control or
               finance that involve terms containing moments of random
               variables, expected utility, etc. We show that the robust
               counterpart of a linear optimization problem with ?-divergence
               uncertainty is tractable for most of the choices of ? typically
               considered in the literature. We extend the results to problems
               that are nonlinear in the optimization variables. Several
               applications, including an asset pricing example and a numerical
               multi-item newsvendor example, illustrate the relevance of the
               proposed approach. This paper was accepted by G{\'e}rard P.

  author    = "Ben-Tal, A and Nemirovski, A",
  abstract  = "We study convex optimization problems for which the data is not
               specified exactly and it is only known to belong to a given
               uncertainty set U, yet the constraints must hold for all
               possible values of the data from U. The ensuing optimization
               problem is called robust optimization. In this paper we lay the
               foundation of robust convex optimization. In the main part of
               the paper we show that if U is an ellipsoidal uncertainty set,
               then for some of the most important generic convex optimization
               problems (linear programming, quadratically constrained
               programming, semidefinite programming and others) the
               corresponding robust convex program is either exactly, or
               approximately, a tractable problem which lends itself to
               efficient algorithms such as polynomial time interior point
